| Sebtember 8 |  5:15-6:00  | I know we are suppose to update this log every half hour, but I got so locked in I forgot to. I will try to write in about half hour blocks, but I'm not too sure how long each thing took. Ater mapping out my plan I started to follow the psuedo code on canvas. Everything was working fine, but I had two issues. First my dice was adding too many rolls. I was suprised when my currentplace kept going out of the board as I had set it not to add anything that would take it out of the board. I think I spent 15 minute debugging trying to figure out what was run. Eventually I asked my mom (she did CS in colledge) if she could see a bug in my code. She didn't want to straight tell me any bugs she saw instead she asked me question so I would think through what was happening and eventually I noticed I was adding the dice roll to current place twice oops. |

Someone it kept either saying too many moves like 15 to get to 98 which makes no sense with the ladder or 1. I litterally had my array saying every square took 0 or 1 moves with the final taking 2 which was just very wrong. Eventually I figured out how to make the total moves work, but on tricky I got another error the code was expecting -1 which I wasn't getting. That took like aother 10-15 minutes of troubleshooting before I realised I forgot to set my code to return -1 if it's impossible/queue runs out. Then after that my code worked so I added my comments and wrote these work logs |
